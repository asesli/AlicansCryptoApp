This is a test project to apply LSTM network to a cryptocoin chart to predict the forecast of the next day. Along with being a test project, this app, in the end, will do all major functions of binace.

##Currently still in the works:

- BUY/SELL buttons will need to be linked up.
- BUY/SELL price/percentage slider and precalcutlation
- Applying a sell date or a sell decision algorithm to already owned items.
- Applting a prediction on a given coin trade pair
- Console needs to have some more main functions:
-  'execute' needs to be expanded to take args & kwargs
- Pause/Start socket feeds when the app is running long running scripts.
- Kill/Start a thread
- The top dropdowns are a bit glitchy. and initial load needs to be better. 
- The graph needs to be replaced. Needs to be have many more options.
- Graphs needs to have buy in/out labels
- The UI numbers needs to be formatted.
- Options dialog
- my_trades.py needs to be autopopulated
